# Cambridge Sensor Network Portal

This project provides a multi-user portal for the management of sensors on
the Cambridge Sensor Network.

The portal is designed to accomodate self-provisioning of sensors that will
be registered on the CSN Lorawan (Low-power, Long-Range) network of radio
gateways in the Cambridge UK region.

The portal has three main areas of function:
* User management - these are the people able to register devices and manage the
receipt of the data.
* Device management - this is where devices are registered and the server designated to
receive their data.
* Server management - this is where user servers are defined that can then be used to receive data from
the sensors.
